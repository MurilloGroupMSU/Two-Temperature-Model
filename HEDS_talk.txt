Talk review


- idea is to explain how difficult normal experiments are of tranposrt and eos
- show laser breadown gas vs UNP and Warm dense exp's
	- parameter space plot by Gautham
	
	
	
	
	
	
Seth Talk ideas- more exp focused
_______
- include S_Î³, say raidation tranposrt etc. zero
- show experiment is black blody
- FWHM behaviour


Key results:
	- large dih of ions - "bond softening" or "non-thermal melting"
	- thermal conduction slow
	- closed system? Doesn't lose energy to environment
	-
