# Some questions about how the model currently works, what limits it and what to improve

Hydrodynamics:
	Currently assuming: - ideal gas for pressure
						- Thermal Kinetic energy is directly related to Temperature, ideal specific heat built in, no potential energy

Ionization:
	Currently assuming: - Zbar from Thomas-Fermi, no dynamics of recombination etc. 


Experiment:
	Currently assuming: - Assume cylinder symmetric along axis, and Te measurement is of core of cylinder
						- How does this actually work?!?! Where is surface? What is measured, bulk T integral (rho T)? To what radius is this integrated?

Photons:
	Currently assuming: - Inverse brehmsstralung dominates 
											- Ignoring Langdon and ion screening effects (See "Inverse Bremsstrahlung Absorption" Turnbull et al.)
											- Ignoring all scattering and assuming photons all come from direct line of sight
											- Instead of integrating over wavelengths, assuming absorption coefficients given by average frequency (ω_av = E_av/hbar = 2.701 k_B Tγ/hbar )

Electric Fields:
	Currently assuming: - Assuming none
											- NO ambipolar diffusion
											
											
Improvements:
	-
