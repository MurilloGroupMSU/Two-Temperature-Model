# Some questions about how the model currently works, what limits it and what to improve

Hydrodynamics:
	Currently assuming: - ideal gas for pressure
						- Thermal Kinetic energy is directly related to Temperature, ideal specific heat built in, no potential energy

Ionization:
	Currently assuming: - Zbar from Thomas-Fermi, no dynamics of recombination etc. 


Experiment:
	Currently assuming: - Assume cylinder symmetric along axis, and Te measurement is of core of cylinder
						- How does this actually work?!?! Where is surface? What is measured, bulk T integral (rho T)? To what radius is this integrated?



Improvements:
