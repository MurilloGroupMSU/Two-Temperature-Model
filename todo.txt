Possible things to do for CLAMS:

1. Adiabatic expansion 
 	 - Derive More paper results, check
 	 - Make TTM a true hydrodynamic model
 	 -Check 3 things consistent: 1. Measured Tdot, 2. Measured Rdot, 3. Expected Rdot
 	 
2. Investigate EOS related things
	- Derive two species P and U
		- get number density (is ideal gas approx good enough?)
		- 

3. Ionization
	- Get ionization from Saha equation
	- For initial pressure, would need ionization
	
4. Assume Ideal initial
	- Assuming initial ideal gas means I know n0 for all FWHM listed P cases.

Experimental Questions to Address:

	1. How is Intensity measured independently of Temperature, to get emmissivity?
	2. How is Intensity measured as a function of radius?
