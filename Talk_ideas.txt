MM & ZJ talk flow:

Intro:
	- need to model WDM/HEDS
		- Fraley paper hydro
		-unkowns: EOS/transport
	-background for other experiments  
		-include TCCW info? 
	- other possibilites
		-UNP’s, + high pressure gases
			-gases for arbitrary mixtures (Bergeson for UNP)
		-Show Gautham Dharuman regime plot

Experiment:
	-Pictures of experiments
	-Setup with laser
	-Show what they measure (Te, Intensity)
		-other measurements
			-transmission paper for fixed wavelengths (done H)
			-x-ray backlight (from water) for S(k)
			-ion Doppler 
			-Thompson scattering (Zbar, ne, Te)
	-Define “initial conditions” of experiment
		-’fast’ timescales things: laser ~ 100 fs
		-’slow’ e-i equilibration, expansion, conduction?
	-Map initial measurements to initial conditions of experiments
	-’slow’ stuff  goes into hydro simulation
		-describe
		-show missing terms in Fraley (or added)
	-Statistics/Results: how sensitive measurements are to G (e-i rate), etc.
		-how closed is system- does this effect observables 
Future:
	-Xe/He ‘highly asymmetric mixtures’ possibility
	-many epicycles
